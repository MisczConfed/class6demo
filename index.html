        <h2 class="textbox">A class about Sass!</h2>
        <p class="parabox">Lets talk about Sass!.. No, not that kind of Sass, The Sass we're talking about refers to a CSS language. Sass short for 'Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets' is a scripting language that compiles to CSS, making it easier to write and organize stylesheets using variables, nesting, and mixins! </p>
        <h2 class="textbox">A bit about Git!</h2>
        <p class="parabox">
            Now lets learn about Git! Git is a software which is used to keep track of changes to source code or other files during software development. As well as files that are being simultaneously edited by multiple users. GitHub is a repository (common storing location) whose files Git manages!
